## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm learning more of the use of Flexbox in the process of writing CSS.
I initially though i would need to employ Bootstrap or W3CSS but it really proved to be unneccessary

### Continued development

Learn the use of Rem measurement and Flexbox properly
